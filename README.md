**STOCK PREDICTION README** 
Welcome to the Stock Prediction Analysis project! This project aims to study and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for predicting stock prices based on historical data encompassing both NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) data.


**Features:**

Prediction Algorithms:
●	Linear Regression
●	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
●	Random Forest Regressor
●	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Sentiment Analysis:
●	Utilizes VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis of recent news articles related to the stock.
Recommendation:
●	Provides recommendations based on combined results of prediction algorithms and sentiment analysis to predict the upward or downward trend in stock prices over the short-term.


**Technologies Used:**
This project utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies to provide a comprehensive solution. Here's an overview of the technologies employed:

Frontend
●	HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content and layout of web pages, providing the foundation for the user interface.
●	CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is utilized for styling and designing the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent presentation across the web application.

Backend
 
●	Flask (Python): Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, is used for backend development. It provides the necessary tools and libraries for
building web applications, handling requests, and managing data.

Algorithm Implementation
●	Python: Python programming language is used to implement various machine learning algorithms for stock prediction analysis. Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and keras are employed for data manipulation, preprocessing, and algorithm implementation.


**Setup Instructions:**

1.	Clone the Repository:
Use git clone <repository_url> to clone the project repository.

2.	Install Dependencies:
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required llibraries.
3.	Running the Application:
●	Navigate to the project directory.
●	Run the Flask server using python filename.py.
●	Access the application through the provided URL.


**Future Enhancements:**
●	Enhance data integration by incorporating additional sources such as sentiment analysis, economic indicators, and news sentiment to enrich predictive models.
●	Reﬁne machine learning algorithms and optimize their performance to improve prediction accuracy, ensuring more reliable forecasts for both NSE       and BSE stocks.

Here's how to run the stock prediction analysis for NSE and BSE data on your local machine:

Steps to Run the Project for Stock Prediction Analysis:
Install Required Dependencies:
●	Ensure Python is installed on your system.
●	Perform the setup.
Clone the Repository:
●	Clone the stock prediction analysis project repository from the provided URL.
Prepare Data:
●	Ensure you have the historical stock price data for NSE and BSE in CSV  format.
●	Place the CSV ﬁles in the designated directory within the project.
Run the Flask Server:
●	Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
●	Run the Flask server using the command python app.py.
Access the Web Interface:
●	Once the Flask server is running, open a web browser and go to the speciﬁed localhost address and port where the Flask server is hosted.
Input Stock Symbol and Preferences:
●	Enter the stock symbol and select the desired analysis options.
View Results:
●	After choosing the company ticker, wait for the analysis to complete.
●	Once done, the results will be displayed on the web interface to choose for NSE or BSE.
Interpret Results:
●	Analyze the predicted stock prices, sentiment analysis, and recommendations provided by the application.
Further Testing and Optimization:
●	Test various stock symbols, experiment with different parameters, and  explore the application's features thoroughly
